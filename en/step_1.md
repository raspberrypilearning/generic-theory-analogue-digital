### Analogue and Digital

You've probably heard the term analogue and digital before, but you may not have really understood what the terms mean. An easy way to imagine the difference between analogue and digital, is to think of the average modern day games controller.

You will notice that on this games controller there are four coloured buttons, and below them a small joystick.

The buttons are all considered digital input devices. They are called digital, because they have only two states - pressed or not-pressed. If a signal, bit of data or physical device can only a set number of states, it is digital. Those two states could be anything though - on/off, 0/1, True/False.

The joystick on the other hand can have an almost infinite range of states. You can push it all the way forward and your character or vehicle might travel at it's top speed in the game you are playing. Move it backwards a fraction and they'll slow down. Move it back a fraction more and they'll slow even more. In theory there's no smallest value for which the joystick can be moved. Analogue data, signals and devices can have ranges of states. Your game character can travel at any speed between it's top speed and being motionless.
