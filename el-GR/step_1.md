### Analogue and digital

You've probably heard the terms 'analogue' and 'digital' before, but you may not have really understood what they mean. An easy way to imagine the difference between analogue and digital is to think of the average modern-day games controller.

You will notice that on this games controller there are four coloured buttons, and below them a small joystick.

The buttons are all considered digital input devices. This is because they have only two states â€” 'pressed' or 'not pressed'. If a signal, bit of data, or physical device can only a set number of states, it is digital. The states can be anything: on/off, 0/1, True/False, etc.

The joystick, on the other hand, is an analogue input device, because it can have an almost infinite range of states. You can push it all the way forward, and this might cause the character you're controlling to travel at their top speed. Move the joystick backwards a fraction, and they'll slow down. Move it back a fraction more, and they'll slow down even more. In theory there's no smallest amount by which the joystick can be moved. Analogue data, signals, and devices can have ranges of states. For example, your game character can travel at any speed between its top speed and being motionless.
